	<header><h3>What is this?</h3></header>
	<p>
		This is a sample project that demonstrates the use of Webpack with Durandal together to bundle your SPA.
	</p>

		<header><h4>Why would I use it?</h4></header>
		<p>
			Durandal is a SPA framework
			built atop the popular Require.js specification, allowing users to modularise their code and asynchronously
			fetch their dependenices on request.
		</p>
		<p>
			Utilising Webpack in place of Require.js provides many benefits, including allowing us to smarly bundle our application
			into distinct chunks, as opposed to completely individual files. This is great for caching, and can give a good boost
			to performance, especially on high latency networks.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are plenty of other benefits, including transpilation support, CSS bundling and more!

		<p>
			This project is supported by an in-depth Blog series title "Durandal + Webpack", which should answer any questions
			you have about how this was achieved. Make sure to check-out the source for a technical view of what's going on.
